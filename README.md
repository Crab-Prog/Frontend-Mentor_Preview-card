<h1> First Frontend mentor challenge</h1>
<p> The goal of this project was to build out a preview card component. <br/>
 I had to make it look as close as possible to the original design.<br/>
I used HTML and CSS. It was my first time using variables in CSS and it was way more easier that way! I'm happy I learned how to make it.</p>
